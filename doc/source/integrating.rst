Integrating
###########

Launching an application is not enough to have ftrack integrated.
In order to do so , integrations are provided separately.

Each integration will provide something similar to the above hook.

The role of this hook is to provide vital information to the application startup, so the
ftrack api and code can be fully loaded and put to the use.
